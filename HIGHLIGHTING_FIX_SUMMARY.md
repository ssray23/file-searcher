## File Searcher Highlighting Fix - Summary

I have successfully fixed the search highlighting issue in your file-searcher application. Here's what was implemented:

### 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was that files were appearing in search results for multiple reasons:
1. **Filename matches** (highest priority)
2. **File path matches** (medium priority)  
3. **File content matches** (lowest priority)

When users saw "No content matches found", it meant the file appeared due to filename/path matching, but the search term wasn't in the actual file content.

### ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

#### 1. **Enhanced Status Messages**
- Added intelligent status banners in preview modals that explain WHY a file appeared in search results
- Shows different messages based on match type:
  - 📍 "X matches found" - when content contains the search term
  - 📂 "Match found in filename/path" - when filename or path contains the term  
  - 🔍 "File matched in search index" - when matched for other reasons

#### 2. **Improved Highlighting Algorithm**
- **Word boundary detection**: Better matching for whole words vs partial matches
- **Fallback search**: If word boundary search fails, tries partial matching
- **Nested highlight prevention**: Prevents double-highlighting
- **Enhanced HTML content highlighting**: Properly handles DOM structures

#### 3. **Better User Experience**  
- **Sticky status messages**: Stay at top of preview for context
- **Visual design**: Beautiful gradient status banners with hover effects
- **Smart detection**: Analyzes why files appeared in results
- **Reduced console noise**: Removed excessive debug logging

#### 4. **Enhanced Path Highlighting**
- **Distinct visual style**: Path matches get blue highlighting vs yellow content highlighting
- **Tooltip support**: Full path shown on hover
- **Responsive layout**: Works on different screen sizes

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now**

1. **When searching "datahub"**:
   - Files with "datahub" in filename → Shows "Match found in filename" 
   - Files with "datahub" in path → Shows "Match found in file path"
   - Files with "datahub" in content → Shows "X matches found" + highlights content
   - Mixed matches → Shows appropriate combination message

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Content matches: Yellow highlighting with scroll-to-match
   - Path matches: Blue highlighting in file path
   - Status messages: Informative banners explaining match reasons

3. **No More Confusion**:
   - Users now understand why files appear in results even without content matches
   - Clear differentiation between different types of matches

### 🚀 **How to Test**
1. Restart your file-searcher server
2. Search for terms that might exist in filenames, paths, or content
3. Open file previews to see the new status messages and highlighting
4. Verify that appropriate messages appear based on match type

The application now provides much clearer feedback about search results and eliminates the confusion around "no content matches found" scenarios.
